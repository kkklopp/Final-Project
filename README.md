HOW TO SET THE ALARM:

-Choose the time you want to set and add it in the following format (HH/mm), please be aware that you have to add a military formated time (24 hour format);
-Click the "SET ALARM" button to create the new alarm;
-Click the "SET ALARM" button to activate the alarm;
-Wait for the time to come :);

The code provided shows a functional alarm clock and a code that generates random math operations and check if it is correct. 
At the moment, both systems are working separately, but the next steps are to integrate it to the math to come out when the alarm rings. 
Also, we are working in a game so the user can choose between the game or the math to stop the alarm.\
